In today's world, violence is gaining momentum. Often people act violently against other people for no reason at all. Sometimes, violence comes even from people who have our safety in their hands, such as the police. Together, however, we can confront this threat and together build a democratic and tolerant world for all people.

## That is how we can do it
StopBrutality allows people to monitor each other's behavior and help others if necessary. For this purpose, there is a feed with other people's incident publications where they can ask for help or warn others of a danger. The user needs to take a photo or video of an incident and publish it in the app. After publication, any person will be able to see the post and respond to it in a timely manner. If a publication gathers enough reactions, it gets highlighted in the top, thus increasing the number of people who would pay attention to it. This can draw the public's attention to unacceptable incidents, such as police brutality, racism, xenophobia, chauvinism, discrimination etc.
