In today's world, violence is gaining momentum. Often people act violently against other people for no reason at all. Sometimes, violence comes even from people who have our safety in their hands, such as the police. Together, however, we can confront this threat and together build a democratic and tolerant world for all people.

## That is how we can do it
StopBrutality allows people to monitor each other's behavior and help if necessary. For this purpose, there is a feed with other people's publications in the app where they can ask for help or warn others of the danger.
